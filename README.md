# Geeklets-GMail
Geeklet for listing unread mail from GMail and uses your Keychain for the password. 

## Setup
1. Copy the *GMail.py* somewhere, I put it in `~/Documents/Geeklets`

## Usage
1. Create a Sheel Geeklet and set the command to `python ~/Documents/Geeklets/Gmail.py YOUR_ADDRESS@gmail.com` (substituting "YOUR_ADDRESS" with the e-mail you want to check)

## Notes
Sometimes things like meeting request will cause the script to fail, so you will probably want to set the *Display status feedback image* to true.

I also set the *Success Image* to something like ![mail_new3.png](mail_new3.png) and the *Failure Image* to ![mail_generic.png](mail_generic.png). Both images from the Crystal Icon set by [Everaldo Coelho](http://www.everaldo.com/)
